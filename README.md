# Neural transition-based parsing for dependency grammars with Arc-Eager

(Project made together with Daniele Barolo from the NLP course at UniPd, held by the professor Giorgio Satta)

This project is about neural transition-based parsing for dependency grammars with unlabelled dependencies, with 2 different neural approach: BiLSTM and BERT. Both models are trained and tested on the Irish IDTÂ dependency treebank from the Universal Dependency (UD) project. Finally, the outcomes are evaluated against the relative State of the Art (SotA) results.
